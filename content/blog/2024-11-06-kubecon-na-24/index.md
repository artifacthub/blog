Artifact Hub has its [first maintainer talk at KubeCon/CloudNativeCon in Salt Lake City](https://sched.co/1howN).
If you're attending KubeCon and want to learn more about Artifact Hub, including how to add your artifacts to it, this is a session where you can learn about it. To quote the session abstract:<!--more-->

> Finding cloud native artifacts, from Helm charts to security policies, can be difficult with general search engines. Analyzing what you find can be a very manual process and you're going to miss out on some useful projects. Artifact Hub was created to ease the pain of cloud native artifact discovery and now provides for discovery and analysis of over 20 different types of cloud native artifacts. In this session you'll learn: 
>  * How Artifact Hub came into existence
>  * How you can discover and analyze artifacts, right on Artifact Hub
>  * Making your artifacts discoverable
>  * Running your own instance of Artifact Hub
>  * How you can contribute to the project
